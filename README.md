# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common CSS specificity issue that can lead to unexpected color rendering in web browsers.  The problem arises from the complex rules governing CSS selector precedence.

## The Problem

The `bug.css` file contains a set of CSS rules that define colors for a div element with an id and a class.  Although we expect the most specific selector (`#special-id.special-class`) to always take precedence, this is not always the case across different browser versions or CSS engines.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to address this specificity issue by using more specific or more appropriate CSS selectors or by changing the order of the rules. To ensure consistent behavior across all browsers, avoid relying on subtle specificity differences and aim for clarity and predictability in selector usage.
