To solve the specificity issue, we can use the `!important` flag or rewrite the selectors for clarity and predictability:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-class {
  color: red;
}

#special-id {
  color: green;
}

#special-id.special-class {
  color: purple !important; /*Using !important (use sparingly)*/
}
```

Alternatively, for better readability and maintainability we can rearrange selectors to ensure the most specific selector comes first:

```css
#special-id.special-class {
  color: purple;
}

#special-id {
  color: green;
}

.special-class {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}
```
